**Mancala** is a two-player turn-based board game. It consists of 6 pits, 24 stones and a mancala for each player. Each mancala has to be on the right side of the player. The player should sit opposite to each other and play in **a counter-clockwise direction**.
 
As setup, Each pit should contain 4 stones except for the mancala. On each turn, the player will take all the stones from any of his/hers pit and deposit one stone in each pit. The player should skip his/hers opponent’s mancala. If the player's last stone lands in his/her own mancala, the player may take another turn.

**The Mancala game has two modes:** 
  * Stealing  
    ==> Stealing mode is if the player’s last stone lands on an empty pit, the player should capture the stones in his/her own pit and the stones in his/her opponent’s pit directly across the player’s pit.
  * No Stealing. 
 
**Game is OVER** when one of the player’s pits are all empty, by then the other player can capture all the stones left in his/her pits and place it in his/her mancala. **The winner** is the player with the most stones in his/her mancala. 

## Implementation:
